# Paddle
Work in progress of a fun little pong game with a multiplayer twist. If you are interested you can check out the game below. It's far from finished though :)

**How to play:** *Player 1 uses the arrow keys, while player 2 uses w, a, s, d to move. Keep the ball in play to score as many points as you can. Good luck!*
